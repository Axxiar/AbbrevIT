## About The Project

If, like us, you're struggling to remember the sea of abbreviations that exist in computing, you've come to the right place. Simply and quickly search for your acronym or initialism to get its meaning and a description.

If you are wandering, `acronyms` and `initialism` are both a type of `abbreviation` and are quite similar :
    
> An initialism, as the name states, are made by taking each initial in a phrase / group of words and then spelling out each of those letters `(e.g. VPN)` <!--Ajouter lien vers VPN -->

> An acronym is made by taking formed by taking the first letters (or first parts of syllables) of each word in a phrase / group of words. `(e.g. Modem)` <!--Pareil lien vers modem -->
